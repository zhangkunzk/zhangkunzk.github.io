[MoRE: A Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Adaptive Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22694)  

Dacao Zhang, **Kun Zhang**\*, Shimao Chu, Le Wu, Xin Li, Si Wei

- This work focuses on the multi-task fine-tuning of LLMs and develops a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for efficient LLM tuning. 
- MoRE innovatively treats the rank $r$ as the expert and realizes MoE-based tuning in one LoRA module, which reduces the computation cost and ensures the LLM capability across various downstream tasks.

[Label-aware Debiased Causal Reasoning for Natural Language Inference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666651024000081)



**Kun Zhang**\*, Dacao Zhang, Le Wu, Richang Hong, Ye Zhao, Meng Wang, AI Open.

- This work proposes that label information can be used to guide the spurious correlation identification. Thus, it treats label information as one variable in causal graph and utilizes counterfactual inference to remove the spurious correlations introduced by human annotations.Finally, it realize debiased and robust natural language inference. 
- We also extend this work into multi-modal scenarios and public one high-quality paper in Journal of Computer Research and Development.
